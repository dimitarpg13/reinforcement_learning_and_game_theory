# Reinforcement Learning and Game Theory

This repository is a **work in progress**.

This repository will provide supplementary material for the following books:
* Sutton's Reinforcement Learning Second Edition
* Dimitri Bertsekas' Reinforcement Learning and Optimal Control
* Blackwell's Theory of Games and Statistical Decisions

We will go through some of the examples and excercises in the books and will write a Python code for solving those. 

For the books on Reinforcement Learning we will discuss and go through the following RL packages - [PyQLearning](https://pypi.org/project/pyqlearning/), [keras-rl](https://github.com/keras-rl/keras-rl), [tensorforce](https://github.com/tensorforce/tensorforce), [RL Coach](https://github.com/IntelLabs/coach), [RLib](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/rllib/index.html).

For Game Theory we will discuss and go through the following packages: [NashPy](https://nashpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [Gambit](http://www.gambit-project.org/gambit15/pyapi.html).
