## Reinforcement Learning

### CS885 Reinforcement Learning - Spring 2018 - University of Waterloo, Pascal Poupart

https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~ppoupart/teaching/cs885-spring18/schedule.html

A graduate course in Computer Science offered in Spring 2018 at the University of Waterloo. The course explains how to design algorithms that enable machines to learn based on reinforcements. In contrast to supervised learning where machines learn from examples that include the correct decision and unsupervised learning where machines self-discover patterns in the data, reinforcement learning allows machines to learn from partial, implicit and delayed feedback. This is particularly useful in sequential decision making tasks where a machine repeatedly interacts with the environment or users. Topics covered by the course include Markov decision processes, bandits, model free reinforcement learning, model based reinforcement learning, partially observable reinforcement learning, deep reinforcement learning, hierarchical reinforcement learning. Applications of reinforcement learning include robotic control, autonomous vehicles, game playing, conversational agents, assistive technologies, computational finance, operations research, etc.
